• DOMAIN: Telecom

• CONTEXT: A telecom company wants to use their historical customer data to predict behaviour to retain customers. You can analyse all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The data set includes information about:

• Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

• Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

• Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Build a model that will help to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This help the company to understand the pinpoints and patterns of customer churn and will increase the focus on strategising customer retention
